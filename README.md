<h2>This is me :v:<h2>

- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas, I'm a full stack Angular-Java developer. I have a Bsc in computer science and working as a software consultant since 2016. 

- 👀 My main interest is ofcourse still career related, but not persé tech skills. I want to pursue a more managing role, but this requires people skill, being able to listen and motivate my peers. But but besides my career, I'm a fanatic crossfit and painter. Crossfit for when I have too much energy and painting for when I need to take some steps back and reflect.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker and Kubernetes to better support our devops engineers. I have a couple of books in the pipeline, like "how to win friends and influence people" that's on repeat and "clean craftsmenship".  

- 💞️ Opensource is my main focus for 2023, get out there, be present, impmrove on skills outside of my job.
